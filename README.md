# Xcode---Ray-Tracer-Challenge-Book
My Xcode project of Ray Tracer Challenge by Jamis Buck

Great Book. A few weeks ago I started to write my own vector, matrix classes, etc. myself.
Somehow I managed to delete most of the files. Swift doesn't come easy for me, Objective-C did.
Anyway I'm using a GitHub repository found here, https://github.com/joshb/SwiftRayTracer/tree/main/SwiftRayTracer
It's very good. I've added a few convenience items to the base classes, but credit to joshb.
